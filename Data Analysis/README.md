# Data Analysis

## 1. Leading Parties of each states:
- We find the leading parties of each state in India, for the years 2014 and 2019, and analyze the similarities and differences.
- We note that for North, West, and Central India, BJP maintains a clear dominance.
- By observing changes over the years, we can determine that BJP has a loyal voter base since they can maintain dominance over the years, not just for a specific election cycle.
- Since BJP is a leading party in a wide area, we can determine that they have a significant chance of winning the national elections.
- In Southern and Eastern Regions, there is tough competition between Regional parties and INC.
- There is no clear dominance of a party in these regions since the winning party changes over the years.
- This shows that the voter base of these parties changes their votes based on the performance of the party compared to having unconditional and generational loyalties to parties.
- It is interesting to note that Punjab, despite being surrounded by predominantly BJP-supporting states, has two different parties win the elections over the years, neither of which is the BJP. This could be due to the cultural differences of the state or due to sharing borders with multiple states and Pakistan.

## 2. Educational Qualifications of Candidates:
- We identify all the unique educational qualifications that a candidate can have and assign numbers to each qualification to quantitatively compare the candidates running for the general elections of each state.
- We find that the most common qualification is 12th pass, followed by Graduate and 10th Pass.
- We also find the average educational qualifications of candidates running for each state.
- We do this over all the years to detect any pattern in changing qualifications.
- It is interesting to note that the states/union territories with the most educated candidates are Mizoram, Puducherry, Manipur, Meghalaya, Lakshadweep.
- This indicates that voters don't care too much about their leaders being overly qualified in terms of education.
- However, we understand that voters still expect their candidate to have undergone schooling since the percent share of illiterate candidates is the lowest.

# Classification Problem

- We Primarily test Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors to identify the parties in each state and their respective positions.
- We preprocess the data to determine the most relevant attributes for classification.
- Using the main attributes for classification, we identify that the decision tree shows the highest accuracy in the prediction of winning parties.
